description: Create a new MDX project entry under /content based on the info I provide.
---

Ask me for:
- title, type, stack, repo link, cover path, status, featured
Then generate:
- the MDX file with consistent frontmatter
- a short "Description", "Architecture", "Key decisions", "Challenges" sections
- any needed placeholder images paths under /public/images/
Do not add backend or runtime dependencies.
