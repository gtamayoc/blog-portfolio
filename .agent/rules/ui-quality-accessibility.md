- Tailwind CSS is the styling system; keep class usage consistent and componentized.
- Use Framer Motion only when it adds clear value; respect prefers-reduced-motion.
- Ensure semantic HTML, accessible headings order, and keyboard navigability.
- Prioritize readability (editorial layout) for blog pages and scanning (cards/chips) for projects.
